# CodePool
Collection of code, patterns, whatever.

## Purpose
Container for what I create: systems, patterns, algorithms, whatever it might be. The first one was a entity-component-system I managed to complete after many tries.

I often get what I call 'content amnesia'. I might be almost done and things become so entangled *in my mind* that I can't make heads or tails of what I've coded.
I'll take a day off or just the night (by sleeping) and look at it again. Despite comments and being able to see the code, I can't comprehend -any- of it, however,
I can sit there at that time and recode it all from scratch. WTF indeed.

Perhaps it's a memory block, or my brain is saying there's something wrong within the coded system. Why not both?

## Goal
Build my own game engine. **The wheel was *meant* to be reinvented!** ... It's my desire, and I don't care that others exist: RunUO/ServUO/ModernUO with ClassicUO client,
Xenko/Stride, Flax, Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, etcetera.
